// Comparison Operators

// Equal - use two equals signs
3 == 3

// Not Equal - use the bang!

3 != 4

// Strict Equal - checks value and type
3 === 3

// Strict Not Equal - same
"3" !== 3 // this is true, it's not equal because "3" is a string not a value.

// Greater than
4 > 3

// Less than
3 < 4

// Less than or equal to 
3 <= 3 // true because it is equal

// Greater than or equal to
4 >= 4 // still true, it's equal

// And
2 && 3 < 4
2 === 2 && 3 !== 4

// Or - "Double Pipes ||"
'2' === 2 || 3 !== 4

// Rule of thumb with condtionals, it will move on if the first value is true.
